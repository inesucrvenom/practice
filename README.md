## About
Various short programs, common algorithms and similar crowd.

Made for different coding websites (checkio, codility, codewars...), and intentionally somewhat obscured in order to make searching for direct solutions somewhat harder. Because of that I also didn't link to original source / creators / respective owner of the problem either.

That means only the solutions belong to me, but I haven't created the problems so I don't hold any rights to them, but their respective owners do.

However, since I used git anyway on them, and spend non trivial amount of time on them, I want to have them in the open.

## Licence
**Tl;dr: Learn from here, don't present materials as yours.**

My code is published under [MIT licence](LICENCE)
However, original problems might not be. Thread carefully.
